# Fancy Post It Machine

[Heroku deployed app](https://fancy-post-its.herokuapp.com/)

## Description

For users that need to keep track of a lot of information, it's easy to forget or be unable to recall something important. Being able to take persistent notes allows users to have written information available when needed. This application can be used to write, save, and delete notes by using an express backend to save and retrieve data from a JSON file.
